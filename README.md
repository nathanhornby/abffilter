#ABF Members Filter

##Synopsis

ABFFilter Extension for Symphony CMS connects IP banning of the Anti Brute Force extension with the Members extension.

##Installation and configuration

Move the abffilter directory to your extension folder and install the extension as usual (Symstem->Extensions->install/enable).

If you want to use the unban via email functionality, you need to create a deticated page that contains the `ABFFilter: unban IP` event that ships with this extesnion. The pages' url handle must also be configured System->Preferences->ABF Filter->Unban URL. Be sure that `ubhash` is set as first URL parameter on that page. 


## Usage

### BF detection and member login

Brute force detection will work on Memberlogin events and Member Password reset event, so there is no need to configure this seperately. 

It is possible to add the `ABFFilter: Ban status` datasource to pages where you need to display information about the visitor's IP status. The `ABFFilter: Ban status` datasource will add two parameter:

 - `$is-currently-banned` (will be `yes` unless a user is not blocked or blacklisted)
 - `$is-blacklisted` (will be as `yes` if users' IP is blacklisted. Note that in this case, `$is-currently-banned` will be set to `no`)

### Sending unban links via email gateway

The event `ABFFilter: Send unban email` can be utilized to send an unban link via email. Please refer to the example snippet from the events' description for information on the field markup.
